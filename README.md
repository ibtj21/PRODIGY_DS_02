## Description  
This project aims to analyze the **World Happiness Report 2024** dataset to explore various factors that influence global happiness levels. By examining key indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and perceptions of corruption, the project seeks to understand the drivers of happiness across different countries and regions. Insights gained from this analysis can inform policies aimed at improving the well-being of populations globally.  

___  

## Overview  
The project involves:  
1. Analyzing the World Happiness Report 2024 dataset to understand the factors contributing to happiness levels across countries.  
2. Performing **data cleaning** to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis.  
3. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.  
4. Identifying key factors that influence happiness based on visual and statistical analysis.  
5. Offering recommendations for policymakers to improve happiness indicators across regions.  

Key Python libraries used include `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn` for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Usage  

### Data Cleaning and Analysis  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Remove any duplicate rows and handle missing values.  
   - Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric, categorical).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
   - Analyze distributions of happiness scores and key factors such as GDP, social support, and life expectancy.  
   - Generate visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to explore the relationships between happiness and various predictors.  

   Key findings include:
   - Correlation between GDP and happiness scores across countries.  
   - Social support as a significant predictor of happiness in many regions.  
   - Influence of healthy life expectancy on happiness levels.

## Recommendations  

1. **Enhance Social Support Networks**:  
   - Social support is a strong predictor of happiness. Policies to strengthen community support systems could help increase happiness.  

2. **Promote Economic Growth and Equity**:  
   - Economic prosperity, as reflected by GDP per capita, plays a crucial role in happiness. Targeting income equality and economic opportunities can have a positive impact.  

3. **Improve Access to Healthcare**:  
   - Countries with higher life expectancy tend to report higher happiness. Investment in healthcare infrastructure and preventive care is essential for improving overall well-being.  

4. **Encourage Personal Freedom**:  
   - A strong correlation exists between personal freedom and happiness. Ensuring greater freedom for individuals to make life choices can enhance happiness in a population.  

5. **Tackle Corruption**:  
   - Corruption negatively affects happiness. Strategies to reduce corruption and increase government transparency could improve public trust and overall happiness levels.
